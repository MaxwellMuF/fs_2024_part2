A row of sleek, modern charging stations for electric cars, designed with a green innovative style. 
The stations are lined up neatly, each with a futuristic look and eco-friendly design.

historic buildings, creating a contrast between urban and natural elements.

emphasizing the importance of sustainable energy solutions.
