Each row shows a zip code (PLZ) and how many charging stations there are in total (Number).\\\n\\\n**Number of Charging Stations per kW:** \\\nWe sum up the stations of one power within a zip code. Each row shows the corresponding zip code (PLZ), a unique power type (KW) and how many there are (Number).\\\n\\\n**Do the tables change?**\\\nYes! Please note that all data and therefore the tables will change if you make a different selection above. If you enter a zip code, only charging stations in this zip code will be displayed. The same applies if you select a certain power. You can change your selection at any time. \\\n\\\n**How do the tables work?** \\\nThe data frames behave very similar to an pivot excel table. If you click on a column name, it will be sorted by this column. If you hover over a table, you will see three options on the right above the table: Download, Search, Full screen. Playing around with the tables is recommended, there is nothing that can go wrong.",

Please note: Availability is not yet live and is therefore only given as a random example. Please do not take this as reliable."
